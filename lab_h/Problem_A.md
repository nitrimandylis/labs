# Problem A
######

# Problem Basics
- Car should turn left when it sees a blue cone
- Car should turn right when it sees a red cone

# Possible Cone possitions 

- Cone's can be put in a staright line in series with eg. a red cone in fornt a blue in frotnt of that another red cone etc...  With the goal of the car to slalom in between the cone's
and reatch a finishline symbolized by a white and balck chekerd line on the ground with a red cone at the right end and a blue one at the left end , or just a pair of one red cone at the right and one on the left.

- Cone's can be put in a curve where eg. it starts with a blue cone and next a red cone thats a fair amount more to the right of that cone everntually making a circle with a series of cone's all
making a curve when that the car has to slalom thorugh , It's possible that midway through the curve the cone's switch to a staright line so basicly the fisrst cone possiblity

- Cone's can be put in a kind of lane where there are blue cones on the left and red on the right , in this case the car has to go inbetween the cone's and follow the 'lane' they make , it's 
possible that the cone pairs have fairly large gaps inbetween them , be carefull not to confuse these with the finish line of possiblity 1 , it is possible for the cone's to switch layouts remember that.
